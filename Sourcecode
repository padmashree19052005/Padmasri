Certainly! Below is a more detailed and structured Python source code to predict customer churn using a machine learning approach with Random Forest. I'll also include comments and explanations throughout the code.

1. Install Required Libraries

First, make sure the required libraries are installed:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

2. Full Python Source Code for Predicting Customer Churn:

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load dataset
# Assuming you have a CSV file 'customer_data.csv' with the relevant customer features.
data = pd.read_csv("customer_data.csv")

# Show the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure
print(data.head())

# Step 1: Data Preprocessing

# Check for missing values in the dataset
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Fill missing values with the mean of each column (or median, mode, or drop depending on the dataset)
data.fillna(data.mean(), inplace=True)

# Step 2: Feature Engineering

# Convert categorical variables to numeric values (one-hot encoding)
# Assuming 'Category' is a categorical column
data = pd.get_dummies(data, drop_first=True)

# Step 3: Define features and target variable
# Features are all columns except the target 'Churn'
X = data.drop('Churn', axis=1)  # Features
y = data['Churn']  # Target variable, where 'Churn' is the column indicating if the customer has churned (1) or not (0)

# Step 4: Train-Test Split
# Split data into 70% training and 30% testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Step 5: Train the Random Forest Model

# Initialize the Random Forest classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Fit the model to the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 6: Model Evaluation

# Predict the churn on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Step 6.1: Accuracy Evaluation
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy of the model: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

# Step 6.2: Classification Report
# A more detailed classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Step 6.3: Confusion Matrix
# Generate a confusion matrix to evaluate model performance in terms of true/false positives/negatives
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

# Plotting the confusion
